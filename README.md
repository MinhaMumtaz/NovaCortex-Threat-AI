# 🛡️ Nova Cortex Threat AI

**Author:** Minha Mumtaz
**Domain:** Cybersecurity • Threat Intelligence • Security Analytics • AI
**Status:** Active Development

---

## 📌 Overview

**Nova Cortex Threat AI** is a modular, AI-driven cybersecurity platform designed to:

* Automate threat intelligence ingestion
* Normalize large-scale indicators of compromise (IOCs)
* Perform deep behavioral analysis of ransomware threats

The platform is built with a **research-to-production mindset**, combining cybersecurity analytics, data science, and deployment-ready engineering practices.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern security teams face challenges such as:

* Fragmented threat intelligence sources
* Lack of structured IOC normalization
* Limited explainability in AI-based threat detection
* Poor deployment scalability of security tools

**Nova Cortex Threat AI** addresses these gaps by providing an **end-to-end, automated, and explainable security analytics pipeline**.

---

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

* Automated threat intelligence feed ingestion
* IOC normalization and structured storage
* Ransomware behavioral pattern analysis using AI
* Explainable ML decisions (SHAP-based insights)
* Dockerized, modular security pipelines
* Research-ready and production-aware architecture

## 🧩 Project Modules

| Module                   | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FeedHub**              | Automated collection of threat feeds (OTX, Abuse.ch, MalwareBazaar, URLHaus, PhishTank) |
| **IntelVault**           | Structured IOC database with normalized schemas                                         |
| **RansomwareBehaviorAI** | AI-based ransomware behavioral analytics and explainability                             |
| **DockerPipelines**      | Containerized deployment pipelines for security services                                |

Each module can operate **independently** or as part of the unified platform.
