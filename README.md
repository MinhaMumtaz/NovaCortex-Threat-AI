## 📌 Overview

**NovaCortex-Threat-AI** is a modular, AI-driven cybersecurity research lab and umbrella initiative. It provides a platform for advanced research in threat intelligence and cyber forensics, following a **research-to-production mindset**. The initiative encompasses multiple sub-projects—some developed (e.g., CortexAI, CortexNexus, OblivionX, VaultX, VaultX-Kernel), some in progress, and others planned—aimed at advancing cybersecurity knowledge, developing innovative tools, and empowering cybersecurity professionals.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern security teams face challenges including:

* Fragmented threat intelligence sources  
* Lack of structured IOC normalization  
* Limited explainability in AI-driven threat detection  
* Poor scalability of security tools
* Weak host scanning and compliance with security best practices


**NovaCortex-Threat-AI** addresses these gaps by offering an **end-to-end, automated, and explainable security analytics platform**.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

* Automated threat intelligence feed ingestion  
* IOC normalization and structured storage  
* Ransomware behavioral pattern analysis using AI  
* Explainable ML decisions (e.g., SHAP-based insights)  
* Dockerized, modular security pipelines  
* Automated Host Scan: Detects SSH settings, firewall status, open ports, password policies, critical package updates, and file integrity.
* Policy-as-Code Validation: YAML-driven rules allow easy modification, testing, and expansion.
* AES-256-GCM encryption and decryption
* Strong password-based key derivation (Argon2 for VaultX, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 for VaultX-Kernel)
* OVAL Compliance Checks 
* Research-ready and production-aware architecture
